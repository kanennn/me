# icebreakers are boring

So I'll tell you a story:)

One dark day in the middle of the night,\
two dead boys got up to fight.\
Back to back they faced each other.\
They drew their swords and shot each other.\
Two deaf policemen heard the noise;\
they went and killed them two dead boys.\
If you don't believe this lie is true,\
ask the blind man, he saw it too.

good morning peeps
